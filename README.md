## üìä Technical Architecture & Stack

This project was built using a modern data stack to ensure performance, scalability, and real-time insights.

* **Data Source**: **Google BigQuery**, providing a high-performance, serverless data warehouse capable of handling large-scale datasets.
* **ETL Process**: An advanced, **real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline was developed to ensure data is consistently refreshed and accurate.
* **Data Transformation & Modeling**: **Power Query** was extensively used for data shaping, cleaning, and complex transformations before loading it into the data model.
* **Analytical Engine**: The core of the business logic is driven by **Advanced DAX Formulas**. These measures calculate complex Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as Year-over-Year growth, price-per-square-meter ratios, and financial yields.
* **Reporting & Visualization**: **Microsoft Power BI** was used to create interactive, descriptive reports and intuitive visualizations.
